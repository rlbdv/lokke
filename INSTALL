Getting started
===============

In addition to the platform specific notes below, you may want to
peruse the [`dev/prep-*` ](dev/) scripts in the source tree as a guide
to the requirements on for any given platform.  Some are being used to
prep the CI hosts, and those should be completely up-to-date.

Platform specific notes
=======================

Debian (and some derivatives)
-----------------------------

Debian is covered in the [Getting started section of the
README](README#getting-started), and that information may also suffice
for many Debian derivatives like Ubuntu.

FreeBSD
-------

The build requires GNU make (`pkg install gmake`), and so please
substitute `gmake` for `make` in any of our build instructions, e.g.

    gmake check

See [`dev/prep-for-freebsd-build` ](dev/prep-for-freebsd-build) for a
set up process that worked for at least FreeBSD 12.2, and please let
us know if you encounter trouble.

macOS
-----

For macOS you can use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install missing
dependencies:

    $ brew install autoconf automake pcre2 gettext git

and then for Guile 3.0:

    $ brew install guile

or for Guile 2.2:

    # Only if you have Guile 3.0 installed
    $ brew unlink guile

    $ brew install guile@2

    # Setup environment variables as indicated after installation.
    $ export PATH=/usr/local/opt/guile@2/bin:$PATH
    $ export LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/opt/guile@2/lib
    $ export CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/opt/guile@2/include
    $ export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/opt/guile@2/lib/pkgconfig
    $ export ACLOCAL_PATH=/usr/local/opt/guile@2/share/aclocal
